## FIGURE 1 · PRD section anatomy — the four questions · Critical · structural schematic
The one-page PRD decomposed into its four sections — Problem, Gap, Tool, MVP Boundary — each shown as a card carrying the single question it answers and its characteristic failure mode. Establishes the document's skeleton before the worked example fills it in. The reader should leave able to name what each section is for and what kills it.
- Spatial: four stacked horizontal cards top-to-bottom (or a 2×2 grid), each with section name, guiding question, and a one-line failure-mode tag in the secondary register.
- RED: none — four peer sections of one document; neutral throughout.
- EXCLUSIONS: no weak/strong example text (that is Fig 6), no $100,000-no content, no Madison mapping, no Build-Measure-Learn material.

## FIGURE 2 · What vs. how — the boundary the PRD must hold · Important · comparison panels
The cleanest single distinction in the chapter: the PRD specifies what, engineering decides how. Two columns of paired examples — a clean "what" statement beside the same statement contaminated with "how" (SendGrid, GPT-4o-mini, temperature 0.2). Makes visible the smuggling that turns a requirement into a false constraint.
- Spatial: two-column table, left "WHAT (belongs in PRD)", right "HOW smuggled in (does not)"; two or three aligned example rows; a footer rule naming the cost — false constraints engineers must defend later.
- RED: none — a neutral contrast of two registers; both columns are equal-weight reference material.
- EXCLUSIONS: no four-section anatomy, no MVP scope lists, no model names presented as recommendations.

## FIGURE 3 · The Build-Measure-Learn loop · Critical · cycle diagram
Ries's loop as a three-node closed cycle — Build → Measure → Learn → Build — with each node annotated by its PRD connection (Build = MVP boundary, Measure = behavioral metric, Learn = hypothesis update). An outer arc labels the PRD as a living document the loop keeps rewriting. The pivot the whole chapter turns on.
- Spatial: three stage boxes arranged in a triangle/circle with curved arrows closing the loop; a centered hypothesis label; outer-arc caption "PRD updated — a living document".
- RED: the LEARN node — the step the chapter argues is the actual purpose of the MVP (validated learning); the one beat the reader must catch first.
- EXCLUSIONS: no code listing, no scope lists, no testable-vs-untestable hypothesis text, no Linear material.

## FIGURE 4 · MVP boundary — the in/out ledger · Critical · comparison panels
The discipline made physical: a two-column ledger, in-scope (five items) versus out-of-scope (eight named exclusions), with the $100,000 no pinned at the head of the out column. Shows that the out list is longer than the in list and that the refusal is the act of design. The chapter's central claim rendered as an artifact.
- Spatial: two side-by-side columns of equal width, "IN SCOPE v1" left (5 rows) and "OUT OF SCOPE v1" right (8 rows); the top row of the out column flagged as the $100,000 no.
- RED: the $100,000-no row at the top of the out column — the single feature declined despite real cost; the thing the reader must look at first.
- EXCLUSIONS: no PRD section anatomy, no archetype-mapping, no Build-Measure-Learn loop, no marketing language.

## FIGURE 5 · Scope discipline compounds vs. coherence spent for cash · Important · line chart
The two divergent trajectories over time: a coherence index (0–100) where the disciplined product holds and rises while the feature-accepting product erodes. Mark the refusal points on the disciplined line and the divergence point where the gap becomes brand identity. Makes the compounding argument quantitative-looking without inventing precise data.
- Spatial: standard chart, x-axis = time / release cycles, y-axis = coherence index 0–100 (zero baseline); two line series, one rising-and-held, one declining; refusal-point tick markers on the disciplined line; an annotation where the lines diverge labeled "brand identity differentiates".
- RED: the disciplined "scope held" line — the primary series the chapter champions; the single line the reader's eye should track. (Second series = ink/gray.)
- EXCLUSIONS: no real revenue figures presented as measured, no competitor names, no PRD section content, no Linear logo.

## FIGURE 6 · Weak to strong — the PRD rewrite ladder · Important · comparison table
The worked example's three rewrite iterations made scannable: weak version → failure mode → strong version, across three rows (problem statement, tool description, out-list). Captures the progression from wish to spec that the chapter walks through. A reusable diagnostic the reader applies to their own draft.
- Spatial: three-row table, columns "Weak version", "Failure mode", "Strong version"; weak cells rendered with a strike or muted treatment to read as discarded; strong cells in ink.
- RED: none — a neutral before/after reference; all three rows are peer examples.
- EXCLUSIONS: no four-section anatomy duplication, no $100,000-no callout, no Build-Measure-Learn loop.

## FIGURE 7 · The PRD as connective tissue · Important · conceptual map
The chapter's synthesis: four upstream/downstream boxes — Archetype feeds Problem statement, Architecture feeds Tool description, MVP Boundary feeds the Build-Measure-Learn loop, $100,000 No gates scope creep in later chapters. Each connecting arrow annotated with what breaks if the link is missing. Shows the PRD touching everything before and after it.
- Spatial: a horizontal row of four source boxes (Archetype, Architecture, MVP Boundary, $100,000 No) with labeled arrows down to their PRD destinations; a one-line "if missing →" note under each arrow.
- RED: none — four equal connections of one document; neutral systems view.
- EXCLUSIONS: no weak/strong examples, no scope ledger duplication, no chart, no exercise content.
